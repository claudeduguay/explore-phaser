# Explore Phaser

This project is an exploration of the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) engine.

I've adapted code from the [Dungeon Generator](https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/tilemap/dungeon-generator) example
in the game/dungeon/DungeonGen source, separating the Dungeon and Player abstrations as much as possible.

Path-finding is not part of the base but there is a plugin called ]NavMesh](https://github.com/mikewesthad/navmesh) 
to explore. See site for [docs](https://mikewesthad.github.io/navmesh/docs/)
