# Tower Defender

by Claude Duguay

## Notes

Each tower and enemy stats need to be refined.

Path timing needs to be figured out.

Damage Formula: <:Enemy Health:> -= <:Tower Damage:> * (1.0 - <:Enemy Resistance Factor:>)
<!-- Shield Formula: <:Sheild Health:> -= <:Tower Damage:> * (1.0 - <:Enemy Resistance Factor:>) -->

Need to account for shields (can disable for now)

## ToDo Planning

Add basic damage to lower enemy health when attacked.
